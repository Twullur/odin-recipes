    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These burgers are the hit of my town. All my friends come over every weekend just for these burgers. With a little bit of basil leaves, and some olive oil, you will drooling all over yourself while you eat these.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make the burger:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Mix together the ground beef, garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, and basil. Divide into four balls, and flatten into patties.

        </li>
        <li>Cook the patties for about 3 to 5 minutes on each side, or to desired doneness. The internal temperature should be at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove from grill and place onto hamburger buns. Top with desired toppings and condiments.</li>
        
      </ol>
